      <h2>All About Crested Geckos</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Crested geckos are not very well known by many people, but they are still an interesting animal.
      Crested geckos are a part of the Diplodactylidae family and are native to New Caledonia. They are most recognizable by their crests all over their bodies and their long eyelashes. They range in size from 6 to 10 inches including their tail. Crested geckos do not have eyelids, but instead they have a transparent scale which they use their tongue to clear debris away. Crested geckos have a tail that can be dropped but not regrown and many in the wild do not have tails. Their toes and the tip of their tail are covered in setae which allow them to stick and climb on vertical walls. Crested geckos are very good at jumping, in fact they can jump 5 to 6 times their own body length! Crested geckos vary in colors, they can be various shades of grey, red, orange, and yellow. 
    Crested geckos are found in nature in the canopy of New Caledonian rainforests. Crested geckos are omnivores so they eat various fruits and insects. In the wild crested geckos are eaten by little fire ants and rodents. </p>

      <h2>Owning a Crested Geckos</h2>
      <p> Crested geckos are low maintenance pets but they still have necessary items to properly own and care for one. 
          Starting off with housing, an adult crested gecko needs at least a 20 gallon tank, however a larger tank is storngly recommended. Crested geckos need lots of vertical space for climbing and jumping so a tall tank is best. 
          Next, crested geckos need decorations for their tank. Some examples of things you might have inside your geckos tank include fake or real foliage, platforms for your gecko to climb and jump on, and logs for them to hide in. 
          Related to decorations crested geckos need a heat lamp to keep their tank at a good temperature because they are cold blooded animals. 
          After that, you also need make sure the geckos tank is very humid as crested geckos are used to humid environments. Every morning and evening and if possible throughout the day you should spray the tank with warm water all around. Make sure in dryer seasons you really spray everything with water. 
          Additionally, make sure your gecko has food and water. Many companies sell food powders that you can mix with water and scoop into a food dish for your gecko every evening. For water fill a water dish each week and check it throughout the week to see if you need to refill it. 
          Finally, your geckos cage needs to be cleaned every week. I recommend cleaning all the non living items in your geckos tank in a mixture of vinegar and water before rinsing them in water and setting them aside to dry. For the tank itself using the same mixture of vinegar and water spray the inside of the tank and wipe it with paper towels, making sure you get all of the mixture off. While doing that you should place your gecko in a seperate container and in a dark place to help keep them calm. After the tank and its contents are clean replace them, after that you can put your gecko back in their tank. Owning a crested gecko is relatively simple and rewarding to see your gecko all happy.
